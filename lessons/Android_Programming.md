First Android Program
- Build a button

----------------------
It should start an activity, with a square button centered in the screen on a
blue background. When you press the button, the background should turn to red.
When you press the button again, the background should turn to blue.

After you have the blue and red alternating in portrait mode, I want to be able
to do the same thing in landscape mode. However in landscape, I want the first
color to be green, and the second color to be orange. At any time, I should be
able to rotate the device and see the appropriate first color, with a working
toggle button.

The app should work in a single activity, not spawn new ones.
Button should be in the center of the screen
There should be 2 colors used when the device is portrait, and two different
colors when in landscape

----------------------
It should start an activity, with four square button, one in each corner of the
screen. Each button will have a different color name for its text. When you
press a button, the background should turn to the color as described by the
button text.

After you have the four buttons working in portrait mode, I want to be able
to do the same thing in landscape mode. However in landscape, I want the first
color to be the same color as was selected last selected in portrait mode. If
I rotate from landscape to portrait mode, I expect the first color displayed
to be the last color selected in landscape mode.

At the start of the program, if no color is selected, the background should
stay white until a selection is made.

When a buttons color is displayed in the background, that button should be
disabled.

The app should work in a single activity, not spawn new ones.
Button should be aligned to the edges of the screen.
There should be only one layout file.
